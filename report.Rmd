## Introduction

Throughout the United States there are wildly varying COVID-19 vaccination rates. Lower vaccination rates in can be due to a number of reasons, such as vaccine hesitance or lack of access to vaccines. Vaccines could be less accessible for populations that live in less metropolitan areas, where it is more difficult to find a vaccine clinic, or in populations that are considered more vulnerable, where it may be more difficult for people to get the vaccine for a variety of reasons. This project attempts to see if there is some relationship between county-level COVID-19 vaccination rates and the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), which using multiple factors to attempt to identify populations that may be more at risk during public health emergencies.

## The Data

This project looks at the county-level rate of the complete vaccine series using [data from the CDC][data1]. A person has completed the complete vaccine series if they have received two doses of either the Moderna or the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine or if they have received one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The main analysis will look at a cross-section of the data on November 30, 2021, and will look at both the vaccine rate on that date and the change in the vaccine rate from August 1, 2021. This date was chosen to try to minimize the effects of early vaccine eligibility differences between states and any access issues that have been resolved before then. This data also contains a variable that categorizes a county as metro or non-metro, along with an SVI categorical variable.

The SVI data comes from the [CDC/ATSDR (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry) Social Vulnerability Index][data2] data set for 2018. This data set combines 15 different factors into four vulnerability themes: socioeconomic status, household composition & disability, minority status & language, and housing type & transportation. These are presented as percentiles and then combined into an overall social vulnerability index, also presented as a percentile. A higher score means that the county is considered more vulnerable. Table 1 describes the variables in the SVI data set.

## Vaccine Data

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
mean1 <- format(mean(clean1115$series_complete_pop_pct), digits=3)
mean2 <- format(mean(clean1115$chg_aug_1), digits=3)

metro_means <- clean1115 %>% group_by(metro_status) %>% summarize(mean(series_complete_pop_pct), mean(chg_aug_1))

m1 <- format(metro_means$`mean(series_complete_pop_pct)`[1], digits=3)
m2 <- format(metro_means$`mean(series_complete_pop_pct)`[2], digits=3)
c1 <- format(metro_means$`mean(chg_aug_1)`[1], digits=3)
c2 <- format(metro_means$`mean(chg_aug_1)`[2], digits=3)
```

Figures 1 and 2 compare the COVID-19 vaccination rate of the average US county to the average metro county and the average non-metro county from August 1 to November 30. (Note that this is not the US rate or the overall rate of all the groups, but rather the average of each county's rate.) Metro counties appear to have a higher average vaccination rate and a higher average change from August 1. On November 30, the average rate for a metro county was `r m1`%, and the average rate for a non-metro county was `r m2`%. The average for all US counties as `r mean1`%.  From August first, the metro counties saw an increase of `r c1` percentage points on average, the non-metro counties saw an increase of `r c2` percentage points, and the average US county saw in increase of `r mean2` percentage points.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
svi_means <- clean1115 %>% group_by(svi_ctgy) %>% summarize(mean(series_complete_pop_pct), mean(chg_aug_1))

svi1 <- format(svi_means$`mean(series_complete_pop_pct)`[1], digits=3)

```

Figures 3 and 4 compare the COVID-19 vaccination rate of the average US county to the average counties of each SVI quartile. Group A has an SVI percentile of 0 to 25, Group B has a percentile of 25 to 50, Group C has a percentile of 50 to 75, and Group D has a percentile of 75 to 100. It appears that Group A has the highest vaccination rate, with a rate of `r svi1`%, with the rate decreasing as we go to less vulnerable groups. Group D - the most vulnerable group - has the highest change from August 1st at an increase of `r svi2` percentage points, and the other three groups about even.

```

These plots also show at least one potential issue with the vaccination data. At certain points in time, the vaccination rates decrease. A closer look at the county-by-county vaccination data, available through the R Shiny app, shows that this is the case in multiple counties' raw data. Also, some counties, such as those in Texas or Hawai'i, only begin reporting data in October, which could lead to potentially inaccurate rates. To try to help mitigate the effects of these problems, only counties with a non-missing change from August 1 greater or equal to 0 were included in the analysis. Also, all data points with a vaccination rate of 0 are assumed to be missing and are removed. The final data set for analysis contains `r tot$n` counties. Outliers were then removed for the linear regression and PCA analyses. Outliers were defined as those that were less than Q1 - (1.5 IQR) and greater than Q3 + (1.5 IQR), where Q1 and Q3 were the 1st and 3rd quartile values, respectively, and IQR is the interquartile range, calculated as Q3 - Q1. Thus we have `r tot1$n` counties for the rate on November 30 analysis, and `r tot2$n` counties for the change from August 1 analysis.

## Vaccinations vs. Social Vulnerability Index

A general view of the relationship between vaccination rate and SVI can be seen in the below scatter plots (Figures 5 and 6), which show the vaccination rate and the change from August 1. There appears to be a slight decrease in vaccination rate as the SVI score gets higher (indicating more vulnerable counties), and perhpas a slight increase in change from August 1 as the SVI score gets higher, but any slope is too slight and has too much variation to say much from these figures.

## Linear Regression

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source("~/project/lin_model.R")
rsq1 <- format(summary(lm1)$adj.r.squared, digits=3)
rsq2 <- format(summary(lm2)$adj.r.squared, digits=3)
rsq1_1 <- format(summary(lm1_1)$adj.r.squared, digits=3)
rsq2_1 <- format(summary(lm2_1)$adj.r.squared, digits=3)
```

Linear regression models were run with both the vaccine rate on November 30 and the change from August 1 as outcomes. One model was run with the four theme scores (as percentiles), percent uninsured, and metro status as covariates. A second model was run with the fifteen SVI variables (as percents), percent uninsured, and metro status as covariates.

Table 2 shows the result of the model run with vaccine rate on November 30 as the outcome and the theme scores as the covariates. The adjusted R squared for this model is `r rsq1`. Table 3 shows the result of the model run with the change in vaccine rate from August 1 as the outcome and the theme scores as the covariates. The adjusted R squared for this model is `r rsq2`. For the coefficients for the four themes, a positive coefficient indicates that vaccination rate is higher for higher SVI scores, implying that counties considered more vulnerable in that category have a higher vaccination rate. A negative coefficient indicates that higher vulnerability scores indicate a lower vaccination status.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kable(t1, caption="Linear regression results of vaccine rate vs. SVI themes")
kable(t2, caption="Linear regression results of change in vaccine rate from August 1 vs. SVI themes")
```

We can see that at the 0.05 alpha level, many of these covariates have significant p-values in both models. The R squared, however, is fairly low, so it seems that the model does not fit the data very well.

Table 4 shows the result of the model run with vaccine rate on November 30 as the outocme and the individual SVI variables as the covariates. The adjusted R squared for this model is `r rsq1_1` Table 5 shows the result of the model run with the change in vaccine rate from August 1 as the outcome and the theme scores as the covariates. The adjusted R squared for this model is `r rsq2_1`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kable(t3, caption="Linear regression results of vaccine rate vs. SVI variables")
kable(t4, caption="Linear regression results of change in vaccine rate from August 1 vs. SVI variables")
```

Again, at the 0.05 alpha level, many of these covariates have significant p-values for both outcomes. The R squared values are again fairly low, indicating a poor fit. The best R squared is for the model of Table 3, which has an R squared of `r rsq1_1`. This has many positive coefficients, and it identifies percent with no high school diploma, percent aged 17 or younger, percent mobile homes, and percent uninsured as factors that may lower a county's vaccination rate.

## PCA

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source("~/project/pca.R")
var1 <- format(sum1_1$importance[3,2]*100, digits=3)
var2 <- format(sum2_1$importance[3,2]*100, digits=3)

source("~/project/pca2.R")
var3 <- format(sum1_2$importance[3,2]*100, digits=3)
var4 <- format(sum2_2$importance[3,2]*100, digits=3)
```

We can try to visualize any trends by using a principal component analysis of the SVI data, and graphing vaccination rates on top of the first two principal components. Figures 7 and 8 were created by performing principal component analysis on the SVI themes, percent unemployed, and metro status. For Figure 7, the first two principal components cover `r var1`% of the variance. For Figure 8, the first two principal components cover `r var3`% of the variance. The colors for Figures 7 and 8 represent the county's vaccination rate or change in vaccination rate from August 1, respectively. Note that these values should be close to identical or identical; however, any differences comes from the fact that outliers for the vaccination rate may not be the same as the outliers for the change from August 1st, so the two data sets may contain different counties.

Figures 9 and 10 were then created by performing principal component analysis on the individual SVI variables, percent unemployed, and metro status. For Figure 9, the first two principal components cover `r var2`% of the variance. For Figure 10, the first two principal components cover `r var4`% of the variance. Once again, the colors for Figures 9 and 10 represent the county's vaccination rate or change in vaccination rate from August 1, respectively.

![PCA with SVI Variables with Change in Vaccination Rate from August 1st Coloring]("~/project/figures/pca2_chg.png"){width=90%}

All of these plots of the principal components generally show the same thing. Overall, it is evident that two components is not enough to cover most of the variance. It is also difficult to see much in terms of vaccination rates and principal components. For both vaccination rate plots, it appears that there might be a slight increase in vaccinatione rate as the first principal component decreases and the second principal component increases. For change from August 1st, there seems to be little relationship between the principal components and the vaccination rate.

## Conclusion

Overall, it is difficult to comfortably make any conclusions about the relationships between SVI variables and COVID-19 vaccination rates in counties in the United States. It does seem that less vulnerable counties may generally have higher COVID vaccination rates, but the data is too varied to really draw any conclusions. For the linear regression models, the best models were the ones for the vaccination rate. 

With an R squared of `r rsq1`, the themes model's results showed higher vaccination rates in counties with a lower socioeconomic status theme score and higher minority and housing theme scores, along with a lower percent uninsured and metro counties. With an R squared of `r rsq1_1`, the individual variable model's results showed many significant positive values, including some in the socioeconomic status theme. Although the coefficients are small, it identified a greater percent with no high school diploma, age 17 or younger, mobile homes, and uninsured as factors that could lower the vaccination rate. It should be noted that it seems that this model had the best fit overall. These four factors seem to make sense with what we know about vaccinations. Less education may lead to greater vaccine hesitancy or jobs that make it difficult to find the time to get vaccinated. Minors are the newest group to become eligible for the vaccine, so it makes sense that the uptake in that population may be slow and may affect younger counties' overall rate. Mobile homes and lack of insurance both relate to factors that may make it more difficult to access the vaccine as well.

Future projects could involve looking at interaction terms within the SVI data set and for the metro variable. It seems like many of these would be related, e.g., metro counties might have more multi-unit structures or more people without a vehicle due to good public transport options. Higher unemployment might also mean a higher percentage uninsured. An analysis of the SVI dataset by itself could lead to a better understanding of how these factors interact. A longitudinal analysis could also be interesting to see how vaccination rates change over time and whether certain SVI indicators change in importance as time goes on.
